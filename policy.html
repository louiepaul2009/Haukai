        <p>
          Like many other websites, we use cookies. We use them to help you
          personalise your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is
          placed on your hard disk by a web page server which allows the website
          to recognise you when you visit. Cookies only collect data about
          browsing actions and patterns, and do not identify you as an
          individual.<br /><br />
          We use cookies for the following purposes:<br />
          - Authentication, personalisation and security: cookies help us verify
          your account and device and determine when you log in, so we can make
          it easier for you to access the services and provide the appropriate

          page or opened an email. This helps us provide you with information
          that you find interesting. We also use cookies to provide insights
          regarding your End Users and your sites’ performance, such as page
          views, conversion rates, device information, visitor IP addresses, and

          policy of the third party placing the cookie.<br />

        <h2>What happens if our business changes hands?</h2>
        <p>
          We may, from time to time, expand or reduce our business and this may
          involve the sale and/or the transfer of control of all or part of our
          business. Any personal data that you have provided will, where it is
          relevant to any part of our business that is being transferred, be
          transferred along with that part. The new owner or newly controlling
          party will, under the terms of this Privacy Policy, be permitted to
          use that data only for the same purposes for which it was originally
          collected by us.<br /><br />
          In the event that any of your data is to be transferred in such a
          manner, you will be contacted in advance and informed of the changes.
          (When contacted you will be given the choice to have your data deleted
          or withheld from the new owner or controller.)
